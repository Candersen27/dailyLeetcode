1759. Count number of Homogenous Substrings

Given a string s, return the number of homogenous substrings of s. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7

A string is homogenous if all the characters of the string are the same.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

Example 1:
    Input: s = "abbcccaa"
    Output: 13
    Explanation: The homogenous substrings are listed below.
        'a' appears 3 times
        'aa' appears 1 time
        'b' appears 2 times
        'bb' appears 1 time
        'c' appears 3 times
        'cc' appears 2 times
        'ccc' appears 1 time

        3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 13
    
        
Constraints:
    1 <= s.length <= 10^5
    s consists of lowercase letters
