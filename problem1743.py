1743. Restore the Array from Adjacent Pairs

There is an integer array nums that consists of n unique elements, but you have forgotten it. However, you do remember every pair of adjacent elements in nums.

You are given a 2D integer array adjacentPairs of size n - 1 where each adjacentPairs[i] = [u_i, v_i] indicates that the elements u_i and v_i are adjacent in nums.

It is guaranteed that every adjacent pair of elements nums[i] and nums[i+1] will exist in adjacentPairs, either as [nums[i], nums[i+1]] or [nums[i+1], nums[i]]. The pairs can appear in any order.

Return the original array nums. If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.

Example 1:
    Input:  adjacent pairs = [[2,1],[3,4],[3,2]]
    Output: [1,2,3,4]
    Explanation: This array has all its adjacent pairs in adjacentPairs.
    Notice that adjacentPairs[i] may not be in left-to-right order.
